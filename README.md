# CheapGPSTracker-Helium

This project provides code and information to build a GPS tracking
device to help find your lost drone, plane, or other item. It's built
with a $10 LORA development board.

It can listen in on an existing GPS wire that is connected to a 
flight controller, or you can use a board with a built-in GPS (about $25).
